Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Australian software developer who spends _far too much_ time experimenting to find ways to work smarter and faster with more reliable outcomes.

## Pet Projects

* [UserFrosting 5 Prototype](https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/uf5-prototype)
  
  The goal with this prototype is to take what works in v4, add support for modern development patterns (namely the relatively independent client side apps made popular by frameworks such as React), improve the development experience (e.g. maximise opportunities for IDEs to infer type information), make make the extensibility more robust (more flexible, harder to break the work), and move to skeleton type projects where **all** dependencies are pulled in by Composer.

* [100% Type-safe React Alternative](https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/tbd)
  
  React (and Preact which inspired this) provide an API surface I'm quite fond of, but have some flaws that make it difficult to be type-safe without a noteworthy amount of effort. The goal here is to make as much as possible type-safe by default and to maximise on the benefits such a system could offer.

* [Theory Test Framework](https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/theory)
  
  I have grand plans here to _significantly_ reduce the amount of code typically required to sufficiently unit test a project.

* [A new kind of JS Package Manager](https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/tspm-concept)
  
  Still in the concept stage, intended to offer a "clean slate" for the ecosystem to break free of dependency hell and guard against certain common pitfalls.

And others which are still at the ideation stage.
