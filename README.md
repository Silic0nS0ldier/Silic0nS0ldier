Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Australian software developer who spends _far too much_ time experimenting to find ways to work smarter and faster with more reliable outcomes.

## Pet Projects

* [Theory Test Framework](https://github.com/Silic0nS0ldier/theory)
  
  I have grand plans here to _significantly_ reduce the amount of code typically required to sufficiently unit test a project.

And others which are still at the ideation stage.
